# Giphy
This application has a series of animal buttons that when clicked populates the page with 10 gifs of animals
and their accompanying rating.  The gifs are not animated by default, but the user can click on the individual
gifs to make them animate.  The user can then click on the gifs again to make them stop animating.  The user can
also add a new animal button to the page by entering the animal into the textbox and clicking "Add" button.  This
new animal button will then display 10 gifs when clicked along with the functionality to make them still or animated
by clicking.
